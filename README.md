Manimohan Mistry’s Portfolio 👋

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This site is a showcase of my journey as a Full Stack Developer, highlighting projects, skills, and the mindset I bring to building meaningful web experiences.

🚀 About Me :

I’m Mohan Mistry — a passionate and driven software engineer with a profound interest in building end-to-end, scalable web applications. I believe that robust code, thoughtful UX, and elegant design come together to create experiences that delight users and solve real problems.

As a full-stack developer, I thrive when bridging the gap between front-end and back-end, working across the entire stack to deliver performant, maintainable products. Whether it’s crafting intuitive UI components or architecting APIs and databases, I approach each challenge with curiosity, precision, and a growth mindset.

🧰 Tech Stack & Skills
Tools & Technologies :

Front-End	React, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript / TypeScript
Back-End / APIs	Node.js, Express (or similar)
Databases / Storage	MongoDB, SQL (or relational databases)
Deployment & DevOps	Netlify, Vercel, Docker, CI/CD pipelines
Version Control	Git, GitHub / GitLab
Best Practices	Clean code, modular architecture, responsive design

I’m always expanding this list as I take on new challenges, explore new technologies, and refine my craft.

📁 Featured Projects

Here on my portfolio, you’ll find a selection of web applications and demo projects I’ve built to solve problems, learn new skills, and push the boundaries of what I can achieve. Each project includes a live demo, the full source code, and technical write-ups or case notes.

These showcase not just functionality, but thought process — how I made architectural decisions, overcame blockers, and iterated based on feedback.

🎯 Why My Portfolio Matters

Thoughtful UX & UI — I believe that user interface and experience are just as important as functionality. I iterate until it feels right.

Maintainable & Clean Code — I emphasize modular, well-documented, and testable code.

Full Stack Vision — Whether it’s front-end frameworks, API design, database modeling or deployment — I’m comfortable contributing at every level.

Growth & Curiosity — I don’t just build — I reflect, learn, and improve. My portfolio evolves as I do.
